# Needham-Schroeder-Protocol-Java
* The Needham–Schroeder protocol is one of the two key transport protocols intended for use over an insecure network, both proposed by Roger *Needham and Michael Schroeder. *
# The symmetric protocol
Here, Alice (A) initiates the communication to Bob (B). S is a server trusted by both parties. In the communication:

    A and B are identities of Alice and Bob respectively
    KAS is a symmetric key known only to A and S
    KBS is a symmetric key known only to B and S
    NA and NB are nonces generated by A and B respectively
    KAB is a symmetric, generated key, which will be the session key of the session between A and B

The protocol can be specified as follows in security protocol notation:

A → S : A , B , Na

    Alice sends a message to the server identifying herself and Bob, telling the server she wants to communicate with Bob.

S → A : { Na , Kab , B , { Kab, A } Kbs } Kas

    The server generates Kab and sends back to Alice a copy encrypted under Kbs for Alice to forward to Bob and also a copy for Alice. Since Alice may be requesting keys for several different people, the nonce assures Alice that the message is fresh and that the server is replying to that particular message and the inclusion of Bob's name tells Alice who she is to share this key with.

A → B : { Kab , A } Kbs

    Alice forwards the key to Bob who can decrypt it with the key he shares with the server, thus authenticating the data.

B → A : { Nb } Kab

    Bob sends Alice a nonce encrypted under Kab to show that he has the key.

A → B : { Nb − 1 } Kab

    Alice performs a simple operation on the nonce, re-encrypts it and sends it back verifying that she is still alive and that she holds the key. 

## Programs
We use sockets to transfer data between programs S, Sok_A_Client Sok_B_Client
To encrypt and decrypt transfered data we use DES symetric key algorithm
